# About

Welcome to **Barravar**!

This page is just another repository to share technical stuff, and it was originally designed to archive solutions of some of the challenges faced over time in a step-by-step/how-to way, making it easy to navigate and find whenever needed to be revisited.

Itâ€™s well know that technology evolves every day, and there are different possibilities to achieve a specific goal. Having that in mind, the steps presented in this page might not be the best no the easier way to handle a problem and provide a solution, and I would be happy to discuss how to improve them.

Anyways, I hope you can benefit somehow from this page.

All in all, thank you for your visit!
